### Python Implementation
```bash
$ uv run aigpt status  
ai.gpt Status
Mood: cheerful
Fortune: 6/10
Current Personality
Curiosity  │ 0.70
Empathy    │ 0.70
Creativity │ 0.48

Optimism   │ 0.36
```

## Key Differences to Address

1. **Fortune Calculation**: Different algorithms producing different values
2. **Personality Traits**: Different trait sets and values
3. **Presentation**: Rich formatting vs simple text output
4. **Data Persistence**: Need to ensure compatibility with existing Python data

## Next Priority

Based on our current progress, the next priority should be:

1. **Interactive Shell Mode**: Continuous conversation mode implementation
2. **Import/Export Features**: ChatGPT data import and conversation export
3. **Command Modules**: docs, submodules, tokens commands
4. **Configuration Management**: Advanced config command functionality

## Technical Notes

- **Dependencies**: Using clap for CLI, serde for JSON, tokio for async, anyhow for errors
- **Data Directory**: Following same path as Python (`~/.config/syui/ai/gpt/`)
- **File Compatibility**: JSON format should be compatible between implementations
- **MCP Integration**: Will use Rust MCP SDK when ready for Phase 4

## Migration Validation

To validate migration success, we need to ensure:
- [ ] Same data directory structure
- [ ] Compatible JSON file formats
- [ ] Identical command-line interface
- [ ] Equivalent functionality and behavior
- [ ] Performance improvements from Rust implementation
